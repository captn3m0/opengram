# Opengram

Copied from <https://github.com/captn3m0/ideas#telegram-to-rss>

There are quite a lot of Telegram channels that are popping up these days that I really like using.
Except there are lots of issues with telegram channels:

1. They are inside a closed network by-default. In order to access them you need to use the Telegram client
2. They are not linkable
3. No sharability without their client, and even then the content is duplicated.

The idea is to create a generic website that does these 2 things:

1. Publish an RSS Feed of every telegram channel it knows about.
2. Provide a direct link for every feed item on the RSS, so users without RSS readers can also browse through the listings.

Since `web.telegram.org` is taken already by the web client, maybe something like `opengram.in` should work fine.
